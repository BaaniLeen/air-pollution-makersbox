# Arduino Code for Makers-Box Air Pollution Hackathon.
This is the code that measures values from dust sensor (Sharp Dust Sensor) and Gas Sensor (MQ135)
It then displays led colour in accordance with the sensor value to indicate amount of pollution, where the led blinks alternately, giving the output of both sensors visually on the same RGB led.
